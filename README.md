# Software Engineering Project

Students tend to find it hard to balance between playing games and having fun and learning something new and interesting. To bridge this gap between learning and having fun, a platform is a necessary. The most critical feature of this platform is that it must be attractive and must make the student want to play longer or rather learn longer. 

The major goal of this project is to design a front-end for an e-learning and gaming platform. The front-end is expected to be simple, easy-to-operate, and user-friendly. The platform also must help easily navigate between different tabs and different difficulty levels. The last but one of the major goals of this project is to create a dashboard to the website where the player can visualize the gaming data.
